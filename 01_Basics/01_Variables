// Concept of JavaScript


// Variable and Constant 
// The keywords in JavaScript define the variable scope and behaviors. 

// var definition 
// The keyword var has function scope and is hoisted.

// Let and Const Definition
// The let and Const keyword have block scope with const requiring and initial value and preventing reassignment.

// What is Scope? 
// The data inside the { }curle brackets are scope. 

const accountId = 144553
let accountEmail = "hitesh@google.com"
var accountPassword = "12345"
accountCity = "Jaipur"
let accountState;

// this is for constant variables
// accountId = 2 // not allowed


accountEmail = "hc@hc.com"
accountPassword = "21212121"
accountCity = "Bengaluru"

console.log(accountId);

/*
Prefer not to use var
because of issue in block scope and functional scope
*/

// an other way to console multiple vaiables
console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountState])
